## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


A therapist directory management system specialized in cross-platform profile synchronization and intelligent matching.

Core Business Components:

1. Directory Profile Orchestrator (85/100)
- Manages therapist profile data across multiple therapy platforms
- Maps credentials and specialties using directory-specific rules
- Tracks profile status with custom states (active, needs_update, exists_unmanaged)
- Implements platform-specific formatting rules for 19 different therapy directories

2. Intelligent Profile Matcher (90/100)
Files: profile_scraper.py, undetected_scraper.py
- Multi-criteria matching algorithm for therapist identification
- Weighted profile matching:
  * Name correlation (40%)
  * Location validation (30%)
  * Specialty alignment (20%)
  * Credential verification (10%)
- Directory-specific verification status tracking

3. Anti-Detection Engine (80/100)
File: human_like_scraper.py
- Simulates natural user behavior for directory interactions:
  * Dynamic typing patterns
  * Organic mouse movements
  * Varied scroll behavior
  * Platform-specific interaction timing
- Handles directory-specific anti-automation measures

4. Form Integration System (75/100)
File: google_form_importer.py
- Specialized credential and specialty parsing
- Maps therapist responses to directory-specific fields
- Validates professional information against platform requirements
- Integrates multiple data sources for comprehensive profiles

The system uniquely handles therapy-specific business rules, credential management, and directory-specific optimizations. It maintains profile consistency while adhering to platform-specific requirements and restrictions across multiple therapy directories.
