description: Specifies data flow patterns for therapist profile management system components

# data-flow-architecture

The data flow architecture implements a multi-stage pipeline for therapist profile management:

1. Data Ingestion Layer (Score: 85/100)
- CSV importer processes bulk therapist data
- Google Forms importer handles individual profile submissions
- Database layer validates and normalizes incoming profile data

2. Profile Processing Pipeline (Score: 90/100)
Data flows through:
```
Form/CSV Input -> Validation -> Profile Matching -> Directory Mapping -> Scraper Verification
```

3. Scraper Integration Flow (Score: 85/100)
Three specialized scraper components:
- Profile scraper validates existing directory entries
- Undetected scraper handles protected directories
- Human-like scraper manages rate-limited platforms

4. Cross-Directory Data Mapping (Score: 90/100)
```
Raw Profile Data -> Credential Normalization -> Specialty Mapping -> Directory-Specific Format
```

Key Data Flow Points:
- Form submissions feed directly into matching engine
- Scrapers verify profile accuracy across directories
- Database maintains mapping between platforms
- Matching engine coordinates data flow between components

Component Integration:
```
Google Forms ---> Profile Matcher <--- CSV Importer
     |               |
     v               v
Database <------ Directory Scrapers
```
