# scraping-algorithms

Core Directory Scraping Components (Importance Score: 95/100):

1. Profile Matching Engine (/profile_scraper.py)
- Multi-criteria therapist profile matching across directories
- Weighted comparison algorithm:
  * Name matching (40%)
  * Location proximity (30%) 
  * Specialties overlap (20%)
  * Credentials verification (10%)
- Directory-specific data extraction patterns
- Status tracking for profile verification states

2. Anti-Detection System (/human_like_scraper.py)
- Human behavior simulation:
  * Randomized typing patterns
  * Natural mouse movement curves
  * Variable scroll speeds
  * Realistic page interaction timing
- Platform-specific anti-bot countermeasures
- Failure recovery for blocked requests

3. Undetected Scraping Logic (/undetected_scraper.py)
- Directory-specific base URL mapping
- Custom handling per therapy platform
- Intelligent failure recovery
- Session management across directories

Key Data Extraction Patterns:

1. Therapist Profile Fields
- Credentials parsing and normalization
- Specialty mapping across platforms
- Location data standardization
- Profile completeness verification

2. Directory-Specific Logic
- Platform-specific field extraction
- Custom status tracking
- Profile verification states
- Coverage matrix mapping

3. Error Handling Strategy
- Intelligent retry logic
- Platform-specific error recovery
- Session management
- Blocked access handling
